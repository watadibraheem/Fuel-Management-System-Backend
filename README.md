# Fuel Management System - Backend

## 📌 Project Overview
This is the **Node.js backend** for the **Fuel Management System**, built with **Express.js** and **MySQL**.  
It allows businesses to submit **fuel requests**, track activities, and handle **admin approvals** for abnormal fuel requests.  
The backend will eventually integrate with a **React frontend** to provide a full-stack solution.

## 🏗️ Project Features
- **Fuel Requests API**: Create, update, delete, and fetch fuel requests.
- **Admin Approval System**: Requests above 200 shekels require manager approval (to be implemented).
- **User Authentication & Authorization** (coming in the next phase).
- **MySQL Database Integration**: Secure and efficient data management.
- **RESTful API**: Well-structured and scalable API design.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js** (Express.js)
- **MySQL** (`mysql2` package)
- **REST API** structure
- **Singleton Pattern for Database Connection**

## 🚀 Project Roadmap
1. **Path #1** (✅ Done) → Fuel Requests API Implementation.
2. **Path #2** (🔜 Next) → User Authentication (Sessions & Security).
3. **Path #3** (Later) → Admin Dashboard & React Frontend Integration.
